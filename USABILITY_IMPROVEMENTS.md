# nanoELS Usability Improvements

## Executive Summary

This document outlines major usability improvements for the nanoELS Electronic Lead Screw system, focusing on enhancing the manual control experience to replicate the feel of traditional manual lathe operation while leveraging modern electronic control.

## 1. Enhanced MPG (Manual Pulse Generator) Velocity Control

### Current Implementation Issues
- Basic pulse counting without velocity consideration
- Fixed acceleration/deceleration curves
- No response to user input speed
- Limited feel compared to manual handwheels

### Improvements Implemented
- **Velocity-based Movement**: MPG now responds to the speed of encoder rotation, not just pulse count
- **Adaptive Acceleration**: Faster encoder rotation = faster movement
- **Smooth Transitions**: Velocity averaging over multiple samples prevents jerky movement
- **Natural Feel**: Mimics the behavior of manual handwheels where faster turning = faster carriage movement

### Technical Implementation
```cpp
// Enhanced MPG velocity control parameters
const float MPG_VELOCITY_SCALE = 0.5; // Scale factor for MPG velocity control
const float MPG_ACCELERATION_SCALE = 2.0; // Acceleration scaling for MPG
const int MPG_VELOCITY_SAMPLES = 10; // Number of samples to average for velocity calculation
const unsigned long MPG_VELOCITY_TIMEOUT_MS = 100; // Timeout for velocity calculation
```

## 2. Additional Usability Improvements

**Recommendation**: Implement a servo-like control system with position feedback and PID control.

**Benefits**:

// PID control parameters for servo-like behavior
struct PIDController {
  float Kp, Ki, Kd;
  float setpoint, input, output;
  float integral, previous_error;
  float output_min, output_max;
};

// Enhanced axis control with PID
void moveAxisWithPID(Axis* a, float targetPosition) {
  // PID calculation
  float error = targetPosition - a->pos;
  a->pid.integral += error * dt;
  float derivative = (error - a->pid.previous_error) / dt;
  
  a->output = a->pid.Kp * error + a->pid.Ki * a->pid.integral + a->pid.Kd * derivative;
  a->output = constrain(a->output, a->pid.output_min, a->pid.output_max);
  
  // Apply to motor
